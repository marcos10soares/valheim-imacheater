## Warnings
> Be careful when using the tool, there could be bugs that are not yet known. (**Anyway, your character is always backed up to the `/bckp` folder where you run the cheat tools exe.**)
> Use it at your own risk, try it first with a new character you don't care for.

## Usage

1. Create a folder somewhere, example on `Desktop` (Note that your character backups will be saved to `/bckp` inside this folder automatically every time you change any items quantities)
2. copy `valheim-cheats.exe` to that folder
3. Run `valheim-cheats.exe` 
4. Modify the quantities you would like and hit save (do not exceed the max quantities of the items or your character will become corrupted) - every time you hit save, a copy of your character data is created inside the folder `/bckp`

**!!IMPORTANT!!: No need to close the game, just logout of the world you're playing to use the cheat tool**
