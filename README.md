# valheim-imacheater
Valheim cheating tool

## Introduction
This tool aims to allow any player to give items to himself, or change any inventory item type or quantity.

**This can be used on multiplayer servers, no admin privileges needed.**

### Why?
**Life is too short for the grind, Valheim is so much more than grind.**

> With great power comes great responsibility, don't ruin your friend's games. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Requirements
Requires Chrome installed

## Warnings
> Be careful when using the tool, it's not fully tested and has bugs, **DO NOT modify any "item listing" that does not have a name**, this is a known bug where the tool is picking up items that are not items and will corrupt your character if changed. (**Anyway, your character is always backed up to the `/bckp` folder where you run the cheat tools exe.**)
> Use it at your own risk, try it first with a new character you don't care for.

## Usage

1. Create a folder somewhere, example on `Desktop` (Note that your character backups will be saved to `/bckp` inside this folder automatically every time you change any items quantities)
2. copy `valheim-cheats.exe` to that folder
3. Run `valheim-cheats.exe` 
4. Modify the quantities you would like and hit save (do not exceed the max quantities of the items or your character will become corrupted) - every time you hit save, a copy of your character data is created inside the folder `/bckp`

**!!IMPORTANT!!: ALWAYS run the program with the game closed. Exit game, run program, relaunch the game**
